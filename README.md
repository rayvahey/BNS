BNS (Blockchain Name Service) - A Hybrid Domain
Name Resolution Service

The above is a hybrid name resolution service designed to ween people from the traditional domain reso-
lution service onto something more decentralized.

The clients speak to this hybrid server using the normal DNS protocol and therefore every device in exis-
tence already has this ability built in.

The DNS server reolves legacy domain names in the normal ways. Therefore the clients never experi-
ence difficulty connecting with their favorite sites.

In addition new decentralized domain TLDs can be added that are resolved against the blockchain regis-
trar.

IS THIS A LEGACY TLD? YES = DNS NO = BLS

Normal IPv4 and IPv6 should be supported.

Notes
Domains purchased on the blockchain should be expensive enough to avoid domain squatting.
Consider an expire time in years, in which additional crypto is required to keep a BLS domain registered.
Owners of a domain should be able to update their domain records as frequently as they wish, this will of
course incur a crypto cost.

The rest is an exercise for the reader. If you like you can contact me at ray@bitchute.com
